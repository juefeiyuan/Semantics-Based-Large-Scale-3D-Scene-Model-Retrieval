3D scene model retrieval plays an important role in content-based 3D model retrieval. To promote this research field, we organized
four Shape Retrieval Contest (SHREC) tracks on 2D scene sketch/image-based 3D scene retrieval in 2018 and 2019. In addition,
there is a lot of semantic information (i.e., object-object, object-scene, object parts and groups) existing in 3D scene models. In
this paper, to further improve 3D scene model retrieval accuracy, we first build a semantic scene tree to incorporate such helpful
semantic information into the retrieval process, and then propose a semantics-based large-scale 3D scene retrieval approach. In
our approach, the object-object semantic relatedness information can be automatically learned by utilizing Gradient Descent-based
deep learning method during the retrieval process. Experiments demonstrate that our semantics-based approach can effectively
capture the semantic information of 3D scene models, accurately measure their similarities, and thus significantly improves the
retrieval performance.
